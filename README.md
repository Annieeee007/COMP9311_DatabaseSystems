# COMP9311 - Database Systems

This repository contains both my written assignments and SQL projects for UNSW's COMP9311 Database Systems (16s1).

#### Assignments:

- A1: ER diagrams and relational model
- A2: Relational algebra, dependencies, and buffer replacement policy
- A3: B+ Tree and transactions 


#### Projects aims:

- Reading and understanding a moderately large relational schema (MyMyUNSW)
- implementing SQL queries and views to satisfy requests for information
- implementing SQL (PLpgSQL for Project 2) functions to aid in satisfying requests for information

**Note:**
- PostgreSQL were utilised for both projects
